## The Project Objective

## The Problem

TOP BANK is a bank that operates mainly in Europe offering financial products from bank accounts to investments, including some types of insurance and investment products. The company's main product is a bank account, in which the customer can deposit his salary, make withdrawals, deposits and transfer to other accounts. This bank account has no cost to the customer and is valid for 12 months, it means that the customer needs to renew the contract of that account to continue using it for the next 12 months. In the last few months the Analytics team realized that the rate of customers canceling their accounts and leaving the bank was raising and that worries the company.
